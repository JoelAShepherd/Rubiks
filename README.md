# Rubik's Cube combinations solver
This program can be used for calculating the number of different combinations that a Rubik's cube can make. 

## Use
Run the file in Node. Input the size of cube you wish to calculate on the command line as prompted.

## Contributions
Pull requests gladly recieved. I've no way of verifying if the large results are accurate to the true value, so any ideas or ways to check would be very much appreciated. 

## Sources
I used the maths from the Rubik's cube articles on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube) as the basis for these calculations.
